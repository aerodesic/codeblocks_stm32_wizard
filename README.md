# codeblocks_stm32_wizard
STM32 wizard for Code::Blocks.  Helps generate a working prototype project

Request updates to C::B to support Notebooks, Grids and enhanced access to lists.
Also can generate LOTS of project files (copies from STM32 "CUBE" folders) so
C::B absolutely needs changes that permit more than 50 files to be generated by
a project wizard.
